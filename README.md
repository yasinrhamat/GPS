# GPS
This program will promt the user to import an XML file containing cities, and the distances between them.
The program will then create a minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm with the nodes being cities, and edges the road between 2 cities.
Once the MST is created, the user is promted to input 2 cities. 
The program then uses Dijkstras algorithm to compute the shortest path between the 2 cities, and outputs the path to the user, like a GPS.
